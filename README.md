# Pegasus Web Age Gate

Age Gate as a Service

### What is an Age Gate?

An Age Gate, also known as an Adult Verification System, is a policy to 
confirm that a website visitor is of the age required (by law) to view 
the website's contents. In the case of Pegasus Web this is due to the 
alcoholic nature of the Carlsberg Group websites.
